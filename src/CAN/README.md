# Using Arduino and the CAN Bus
This directory contains many Arduino programs I have written--both finished and unfinished--using the Seeed Studio CAN Bus shields.

CAN stands for 'Controlled Area Network' and is used as the standard network in automobiles, industry equipment, and many space applications. 

My research on securing this network is primarily done with the code in the 'CAN\_SHA1\*' files--mostly in 'CAN\_SHA1\_send' and 'CAN\_SHA1\_read.' So please refer to those programs for the best examples.
